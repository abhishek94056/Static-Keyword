Bullet points:

1. The static data is common data amongst all objects.

2. We access static data NOT by object name but by class name.

3. To access static data, we don't need objects.

4. If we have some common value for all the objects then that value can be stored in static variable.

5. The static method can access static variables only. It can not access non-static variables.

6. The non-static method can access static as well as non-static variables.

Diff between static and final:
static is common and final is constant.
static can change its values n times.
final can not change values once assigned.
